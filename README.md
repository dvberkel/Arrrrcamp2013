> Pirate Power Play: How to do computation by playing games
>
> Every pirate likes to play games. Whether to pass the time during
> long sea voyages or entertain fellow pirates around the drinking
> table, games are a wonderful pastime. Unfortunately the captain does
> not always understand. Would it not be great to have a proper defense
> when the captain scolds you for idling away time? This talk will
> provide you with enough gun powder to counter any attack your captain
> launches on you for playing games on deck.
>
> We will dive into the seven seas of computational complexity and
> discuss a uniform means of understanding them: games! We show that
> playing games corresponds to certain types of computations. And as
> every captain knows, before finding the treasure you have to compute
> where X marks the spot.
>
> We will use ruby to demonstrate the correspondence between
> computations and games by creating specific games that perform
> certain computations and playing them life.

Usage
-----

We use [rvm][] to manage our ruby versions and gemsets. The project
contains a `.rvmrc` file to change environment upon entering the
working directory.
